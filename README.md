# My Project
 🏠 Real Estate Data Science Application
 
🔹 Introduction

This project is a full-scale data science application designed for the real estate industry. It focuses on property price prediction, analytics, and personalized recommendations using advanced machine learning and AI techniques.
The system was built from data gathering (web scraping) to production-level deployment (AWS + Streamlit), making it a complete end-to-end capstone project.

It enables:
Accurate price prediction of houses & flats
Market insights through interactive analytics dashboards
A recommender system suggesting properties based on facilities, price, and location
A user-friendly web app accessible to end-users

🔹 Key Features


✔️ Data Pipeline – Automated collection & cleaning of property listings from 99acres and other sources

✔️ Feature Engineering – Luxury score, furnishing details, age of possession, room indicators, etc.

✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Insights through Pandas Profiling, scatter plots, pie charts, maps, and word clouds

✔️ Price Prediction – Regression models (Linear, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, MLP, etc.) compared, with best model deployed

✔️ Recommendation System – Personalized suggestions based on price, location, and amenities

✔️ Analytics Dashboard – Geographical maps, scatter plots, and property insights

✔️ Productionalization – Streamlit web app deployed on AWS for scalability and real-world use
